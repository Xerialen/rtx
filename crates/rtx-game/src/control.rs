//! External bot-control channel — the rocket-jump tuning harness.
//!
//! A cvar-gated (`rtx_control_port`) localhost TCP server an external driver connects to in order to
//! *puppet* a bot: teleport it to a rocket-jump link's launch cell, order it to fly that specific
//! link, and read back per-attempt telemetry (stance offset, aim error, fire-timing error, landing
//! miss). The point is a scripted tuning loop — sweep every RJ link a map generates, see which land,
//! turn the `rtx_rj_*` knobs, re-run — without hand-flying bots in a live server.
//!
//! ## Threading
//! The engine drives this module single-threaded from the frame calls, so every `GameState` mutation
//! stays on that thread. The socket work is pushed to background threads that only shuttle raw wire
//! frames through `mpsc` channels — the exact shape as the navmesh build worker
//! ([`crate::nav_build`]): a listener thread accepts connections, a per-connection reader thread feeds
//! inbound request frames (tagged with a connection id) to [`ControlState::requests_rx`], and a writer
//! thread drains outbound frames to their targets — a reply to the client that asked, an event to all
//! connected clients (so the MCP bridge and the navview viewer can attach at once). Requests are
//! decoded and executed, and events emitted, entirely inside
//! [`frame_begin`]/[`frame_end`] under the frame's `&mut GameState`. No lock is ever held over game
//! state; the only shared state between threads is the raw socket and the channels.
//!
//! ## Protocol
//! Framed [msgpack] of the typed [`rtx_ctlproto`] schema (`[u32 LE len][payload]`). Inbound is a
//! [`Request`] (`id` + [`Cmd`]); outbound is a [`Msg`] — a `Reply { id, Result<Resp, String> }`
//! correlated to the request, or an async [`Event`] (`arrived` / `goto_stall` / `rj_result` /
//! `fly_result`). A single outbound channel gives total ordering; the client demuxes on the `Msg`
//! variant. The MCP re-serialises the typed values as JSON for Claude.
//!
